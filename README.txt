This folder contains all the files and functions needed to run the Portfolio Analysis Tool.

The easiest way to use this code is to run the 'Sample report.rpt' file through MATLAB's Report
Explorer (accessed by running the command 'setedit' at the MATLAB prompt).

Please make sure all the files in this folder are in MATLAB's path. This software has been tested
and works on a trial version of MATLAB 2011b and a student installation of MATLAB 2010b.

This code may take as long as 20 minutes to execute due to how computationally intensive the optimization is.

All of this code EXCEPT for pie2.m was authored by George Kalogeropoulos.
